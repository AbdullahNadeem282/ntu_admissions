Brief Introduction:
Last few years have been a difficult time for all the world due to the most dangerous pandemic in the history of Mankind. Covid19 has significantly impacted the human life around the globe. Due to the lock down in almost all the world, the businesses have been badly affected throughout the world. In this hard time, Pakistan’s Apparel industry has performed exceptionally very well. Most of the industries immediately shifted their production facilities to make safety related products such as face masks and protective suits etc. The Apparel industry which already has a lion’s share in the total exports has shown further increase in export from last many months. Further, the steps taken by the Govt. has also helped this industry to take up this pace. It is expected that the increase in exports will continue further in future. The growth has already given the Apparel industry some space for new investments in capacity enhancement or developing new units. To keep up the current pace, it is necessary to have the human resource with right skill set for this industry.

BS Artificial Intelligence


The Bachelor of Science in Artificial Intelligence - BS(AI) program gives students the in-depth knowledge they need to transform large and complex scenarios into actionable decisions. The program and its curriculum focus on how complex inputs — such as knowledge, vision, language, and huge databases — can be used to make decisions to enhance human capabilities. The BS (AI) program curriculum includes coursework in computing, mathematics, automated reasoning, statistics, computational modelling, introduction to classical artificial intelligence languages and case studies, knowledge representation and reasoning, artificial neural networks, machine learning, and natural language processing vision and symbolic computation. The program also encourages students to take courses in ethics and social responsibility, with the opportunity to participate in long term projects in which artificial intelligence can be applied to solve problems that can change the world for the better — in areas like agriculture, defense, healthcare, governance, transportation, e-commerce, finance, and education.

Current Issues in Interior Design
This course addresses the issues emanating from this conflict: “Design education lacks coherence, interdisciplinary approaches and collaboration between various programs and industries. Professionals are in desperate need of understanding regulations and legislation”. More than ever, the challenges that face both the academic and the professional world should come under scrutiny. This course review examines and discusses the recent literature about the ongoing debate and critique found in various circles, which seek to minimise this schism. Especial attention will be given, throughout this course, to what students should expect what design process to adopt and most of all, under what academic vision should all the above fall to push research in that direction. In this course, students will conceptualise and engage in research through design as part of the creative process to open the potential for new understandings, experimentation, and innovation. Students will be able to communicate ideas and designs verbally, visually, and textually through various media to their peers and professional, academic, and public audiences. The course is designed to reflect, analyse, synthesise, critique, and evaluate students' work as well as that of peers and apply your knowledge and skills with initiative and insight in professional practice and scholarship.

BS Applied Statistics (Evening Program)


B.S. Applied Statistics 4 years’ degree program primarily focusing on development and application of methods to collect, analyze, interpret, and learn from data. Since data are witnessed in almost every field, including the natural and social sciences, medicine, industry, finance, and engineering, statistics are crucial in understanding the world around us. Good statistical practice relies on comprehensive critical thinking that merges quantitative, mathematical and computer science skills with qualitative forms of thought, such as communicating results, assimilating new information with old, and assessing implications of new manifestations. With this in mind, the proposed program will aim at coupling methodological tools with multi-disciplinary applications, technical writing, and communication skills.
